This is a project for a portfolio site, showcasing current skills, interests and the process that is used for creating websites and working on client projects.

The project is used for attracting new clients and prospective employers, to allow them to gain interest in my work, and how I take on new challenges.

The reason for red colours and accents towards the red colours, is that red is my favourite colour, and, as I am colour blind it is sometimes hard to find the right balance in terms of colours matching up. Red is a very distinctive colour, allowing me to use this for the correct balance.

The site had to be clean, minimal and there was a need for focus on the site’s content, and, with the creation of this site, this goal has been achieved. 

Prospective employers and clients can have an overview of who I am, what skills I possess, and what sites I have created in my time as a junior developer / freelance developer.


# UX
## For what users is the site created?
The site is created for prospective employers and prospective clients, to allow them an insight in my work process, my previous work / development jobs, and what interests I have further besides my development skills.

## What need had to be fulfilled?
A website, that was pleasing to the eyes, interactive on different view-windows, sparks interest, and portraying a minimalist design.
How has the project helped achieve this goal?
The goal has been achieved, by using a minimalist approach, with responsive design, different options visible on different view-windows. For example, the process section changes from small view-window (mobile) to large view-window, where the process is shown in a full section, as opposed to dropdown clickable buttons.

## User Stories
* As a potential customer, I want to have an overview of previous websites created, what skills was used, and a link towards that website to show me the working example
* As a potential employer, I want to have an insight in the thought-process of how a design is coming to life, from A to Z
* As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to easily navigate between sections and find the menu for the site
* As a potential customer, I want to be able to contact the site owner, find details on a contact number, and fill in a contact form to allow me to ask questions

## Wireframes / menu / colour options
Please see the following document, for:
* Wireframes
* Colours used in the site, and why these colours are the choosen colours
* Example colour lay-outs

# Features
The website uses a “one-page” design. A navigation on top, which collapses into a burger menu for mobile view. 

The hamburger menu icon has a comment next to it *“menu ->”* which hints the user that the menu is hidden behind the “burger” icon, representing the menu. This is done so there is a bit of a playful character given to the site. Just a small touch. As the site symbolizes minimalism, these small touches make it stand out.

## Intro
The home section, or, intro section, features just a small paragraph of text, showing the text *“I am a Designer / Junior Developer living in Ireland.”*

The reason for this sentence/slogan is that I am originally not from Ireland, and this allows a bit of insight in where I am currently located. Also, this allows visitors from different countries to immediately understand where I am located.

It also has a large heading, informing the visitors that I am a *“creator”*. The intention for this is done, to allow a build-up of interest, in seeing more.

Then below the heading and paragraph of text, there is a button, with the text “get to know me..” once the user clicks on this button, it brings them to the about section.

## About
Once you click on the *“get to know me...”* you will be brought to the next logical section, which is the about section, advising visitors who I am, what I have done so far career-wise, and a little bit of my personal interests highlighted.

There is also a link to my full resume, to allow visitors to see my current resume, and full work experience further highlighted.

I added the information that I work in the IT industry for a long period of time, to inform them that I am aware of the current technological advances that are happening in this sector.

To make it more playful, there are some words replaced with Font Awesome icons, representing:
* Chip symbol = technology
* Heart symbol = love for
* Coding symbol = coding
* Weights symbol = gym/fitness
* Movie symbol = movies

Then followed by a percentage bar graphic, with an interactive moving slider. Showcasing my current skill-level of certain coding languages and knowledge I possess.

The percentage bar graphic, changes in icons for the respective languages on smaller view-windows, to avoid further distraction, and to keep it within the team of minimalism.

##Portfolio
The portfolio section, or, project section, is in line with the minimalism theme we want to portrait. It has a large image of the site that I have created, a small heading for the name of the project / site, and a paragraph detailing what I have done for the site, what coding skills I have applied.

Once clicked on the image, it then brings you to the company / page, in a new window in the browser. To allow users to visit the live site, see and experience the site for themselves, as opposed to reading about it in full a lot of words. Many words are distracting, and would not be read, as attention span of visitors is often low, and only a select amount of people will read the full paragraphs.

## Process
The process section, describes the process that I use or, apply to a new project. I have added a process section to the site, to allow visitors and future employers, an insight in my thought-process and how I allow new clients to work with me.

I have thought of a simple four step process:

**Step 1:**
During initial call or meeting, depending on what is preferred, we will discuss any kind ideas you have, preferences, colours, for the site. I will then use this information, to create examples. These examples usually are created using wireframing and allows me to present the client with a good idea of what to expect. I will also discuss pricing as far as I can advise at this point, and these are subject to change. I will also advise the client what is required and what kind of hosting we most likely need to get. As this is based on freelance services, I work on 50% paid up-front, and 50% once work is completed. We also discuss milestones, so we have key-dates to work towards to, and I will discuss a shared drive/folder, to allow the client to upload any files necessary.

**Step 2:**
After about two working weeks, I will show you my examples. We will then discuss further what design examples work and which ones do not align with the vision the client has. From here onwards, I will then proceed to step #3, which is creating the actual site. We will then if needed re-align any milestones set, if they are still feasible, and, then plan accordingly.

**Step 3:**
In this step, I will present you examples, that I have created based on your input, and if not fully provided yet in previous step, you will then give me the remaining details, like specific texts, any images if not already provided and any other additional details that we would most likely need to add.

**Step 4:**
In this step, we will test the site extensively, once the tests have completed and the client has signed off on the testing and confirms he/she is happy with the result, we will move the site to go-live. You then have a week to test the backend access, which we could do through WordPress, or any similar CMS, and I will be available for questions. After this week, I will invoice any hours spend, on adjustments or, anything else related to the project.
The reason for only entering this in a four-step process, is for the client to not get confused, about what is expected from them, and how I want to work with them, and apply their assistance to the site.
The steps evolve from buttons to a static part of the site, on larger view-windows.

## Contact
Here you will find a form, to allow customers or potential recruiters to fill in a contact request. Below the contact section, we also have the footer section, which includes both my office number and as well my direct email address.

I have chosen for this option / feature, as not everyone is inclined to fill in a contact form, but rather does this through a direct email.

I have chosen to use formspree to allow entries of the form, to be forwarded to my direct email address.

The contact section is also managed by a form-checker, as there are some fields which are mandatory:
* Name (first and last)
* Email address
* Text field
* Any other fields, are optional, and not necessary to be filled in.*
