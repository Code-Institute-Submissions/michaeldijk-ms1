## Personal Portfolio site

---
This is a project for a portfolio site, showcasing current skills, interests and the process that is used for creating websites and working on client projects.

The project is used for attracting new clients and prospective employers, to allow them to gain interest in my work, and how I take on new challenges.

The reason for red colours and accents towards the red colours, is that red is my favourite colour, and, as I am colour blind it is sometimes hard to find the right balance in terms of colours matching up. Red is a very distinctive colour, allowing me to use this for the correct balance.

The site had to be clean, minimal and there was a need for focus on the siteâ€™s content, and, with the creation of this site, this goal has been achieved. 

Prospective employers and clients can have an overview of who I am, what skills I possess, and what sites I have created in my time as a junior developer / freelance developer.


# UX
## For what users is the site created?
The site is created for prospective employers and prospective clients, to allow them an insight in my work process, my previous work / development jobs, and what interests I have further besides my development skills.

## What need had to be fulfilled?
A website, that was pleasing to the eyes, interactive on different view-windows, sparks interest, and portraying a minimalist design.
How has the project helped achieve this goal?
The goal has been achieved, by using a minimalist approach, with responsive design, different options visible on different view-windows. For example, the process section changes from small view-window (mobile) to large view-window, where the process is shown in a full section, as opposed to dropdown clickable buttons.
